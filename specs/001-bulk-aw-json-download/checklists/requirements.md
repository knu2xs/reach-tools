# Specification Quality Checklist: Bulk AW Reach JSON Downloader

**Purpose**: Validate specification completeness and quality before proceeding to planning  
**Created**: 2026-05-11  
**Feature**: [spec.md](../spec.md)

## Content Quality

- [x] No implementation details (languages, frameworks, APIs)
- [x] Focused on user value and business needs
- [x] Written for non-technical stakeholders
- [x] All mandatory sections completed

## Requirement Completeness

- [x] No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers remain
- [x] Requirements are testable and unambiguous
- [x] Success criteria are measurable
- [x] Success criteria are technology-agnostic (no implementation details)
- [x] All acceptance scenarios are defined
- [x] Edge cases are identified
- [x] Scope is clearly bounded
- [x] Dependencies and assumptions identified

## Feature Readiness

- [x] All functional requirements have clear acceptance criteria
- [x] User scenarios cover primary flows
- [x] Feature meets measurable outcomes defined in Success Criteria
- [x] No implementation details leak into specification

## Notes

- All items pass. Ready to proceed to `/speckit.plan`.
- Key open design question handled via assumption: invalid reaches may manifest as HTTP 4xx/5xx, empty body, null JSON, or missing fields — all cases must be handled.
- Python language assumption is noted (consistent with project conventions) but implementation language is not prescribed in requirements.
